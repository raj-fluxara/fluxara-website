# 3D Animated Background - Installation Guide

## Current Status ✅
The animated background is **already working** with a beautiful CSS fallback animation! You'll see:
- Floating particles in your brand colors (orange, blues, teals)
- Animated flowing lines representing data transformation
- Subtle, enterprise-appropriate animation behind your hero content

## Optional: Enable Full 3D Animation

To upgrade to the advanced 3D WebGL animation, install Three.js:

```bash
npm install three @types/three
```

After installation, refresh the page and the component will automatically:
- Load the full 3D WebGL renderer
- Display 150+ animated particles with physics
- Show flowing connection lines with 3D depth
- Animate the transformation from scattered data to organized patterns

## What you get with Three.js:
- **3D particles** that move in 3D space with physics simulation
- **Flowing connections** with curved 3D paths
- **Data transformation** animation (chaos → organized patterns)
- **Smooth 60fps** WebGL rendering with hardware acceleration
- **Advanced camera** movement and lighting effects

## What you have now (CSS fallback):
- **2D particles** with pulse animations
- **Flowing lines** with gradient effects  
- **Brand colors** perfectly matching your design
- **Lightweight** and works on all devices
- **Enterprise-ready** professional appearance

Both versions are production-ready and designed for Fortune 500 presentations!
